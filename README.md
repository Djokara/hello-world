Slaughterhouse-Five
Or
The Children's
Crusade
A dutty-dance with death
By
Kurt Vonnegut
A fourth-generation German-American
Now living in easy circumstances
On Cape Cod
[And Smoking Too Much]
Who, as an American infantry scout
Hors de combat
As a prisoner of war
Witnessed the fire-bombing
of Dresden, Germany
"The Florence of Elbe"
A long time ago
And lived to tell the tale
This is a novel
Somewhat in the telegraphic schizophrenic
Manner of tales
Of the planet Tralfamadore
Where the flying saucers
come from
PEACE
